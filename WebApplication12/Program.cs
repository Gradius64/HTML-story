GIVEN a Prework Study Guide website
WHEN I visit the website in my browser
THEN I see four boxes titled HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript with associated notes listed
WHEN I view the study guide
THEN I see a dark blue header and footer, and four boxes with a shadow
WHEN I open the console in my browser
THEN I can see the four topics I learned listed along with a suggestion on what I should study first
WHEN I visit the website using the URL
THEN I can access my website from any browser
